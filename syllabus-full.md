# Grading Scale

A numerical scale is given on the syllabus for translating your homework and exam averages to a letter grade. Your final letter grade will be at a minimum that determined by the formula given in the syllabus. Your final letter grade may be adjusted upwards based on the following two considerations.

1\. Some students improve consistently throughout the semester. As a result, if your final exam percentage is higher than your midterm percentage, your midterm percentage is replaced with your final percentage. Same for your homework percentage. (_This is not stated in the syllabus and I typically reveal it after the midterm._)

2\. Prior to assigning a final letter grade, I look to see if the letter grades are consistent with the following guidelines. If, for example, there are many students with grades between 85\% and 90\% that have demonstrated A--level mastery, their final grade will be an $A-$, $A$, or $A+$. (I don't "curve" in the sense that I don't adjust grades to match a distribution or average.) The levels of mastery and associated letter grades are described below. In the past, I have found that consideration of the following typically leads to an average upwards adjustment of approximately 1/2 of a letter grade.

**A--level mastery** -- Can solve and explain at a conceptual level key concepts in problems that are similar to or closely related to homework problems and example problems in the textbook. Evidence for this is based primarily on their exam solutions; previous interactions with students or their homework solutions will be factored in if their exam score is inconsistent with my estimation of how much the student understands. Mastery at this level does not require perfect solutions. However, when a solution clearly does not make sense, these students are able to identify the problem with the solution.

**B--level mastery** -- A mixture of A and B level mastery.

**C--level mastery** -- Difficulties solving some of the more challenging example-level problems that were previously covered in a freshman--level physics course even after they were reviewed in this course. Weak understanding of the justifications and motivations for steps in textbook example problems and HW problems after a detailed solution was given. For example, I cover the problem of setting up the integral needed to find the field due to a finite line of charge at a distance from the center of the line in class; in my notes I give a sequence of steps and methods for checking each step. On an exam with the same problem rotated by 90 degrees, these students have difficulty writing down the $\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'$ vector and they may write $1/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|$ as $1/( (x-x')\xhat +(y-y')\yhat )$ even after being told in class many times that the inverse of a vector does not makes sense in this class. These students find the textbook too be too abstract; they may be able to reproduce the mechanics or steps required for a solution, but a physical understanding of the solution is usually lacking.

**D--level mastery** -- At the end of the semester, difficulty with the $\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'$ notation and often write equations with vector = scalar. These students have difficulty in sketching piece--wise functions and translating words into diagrams. When intermediate steps are ommitted in solutions because the concept has been covered many times before, these students are unable to, or have major difficulty, in filling in the intermediate steps. Exam problems that are similar to or idential to problems covered on the homework typically have only a few equations written down that seem to have been memorized.

**F--level mastery** -- A lack of understanding of fundamental concepts covered in the freshman--level physics course (PHYS 260 or equivalent). Evidence for this includes (1) frequently writing equations that are correct but not related to the problem, (2) writing solutions that are clearly wrong based on basic concepts and not giving an explanation for why the solution is clearly wrong, (3) an inability to solve the parts of a problem that rely on concepts that were commonly used in physics 160, 260, and calculus courses. Prior to repeating this course, students would benefit from spending 20--30 hours reviewing the basic mathematical concepts used in this course and also practice solving problems in a freshman--level physics textbook.

# Topics

These notes are a supplement to the textbook. The topics, explanations, and examples were motivated by issues encountered when students attempted to solve Griffiths--level problems based only reading the textbook and attending a lecture on related topics.

Students are encouraged to attempt homework problems after careful study of the relevant sections of the textbook. It is important that you understand what you don't understand before being given additional guidance that these notes provide.

1. $\sqrt{x^2}$ - Note than $\sqrt{r^2}=|r|=r$ because by definition $r\ge 0$. Give equations from notes where this occurs and ask them to plot case where this was not used.
1. Piecewise Functions
2. Legendre Polynomial notation $P_n(\cos\alpha)$ does not mean the same thing as $\cos\alpha P_n$.
