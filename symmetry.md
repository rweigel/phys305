# Symmetry

In E&M, we frequently make use of symmetry arguments to simplify problems. Two types of symmetry are used.

1. Geometrical, in which we make statements about properties of the solution based on the arbitrariness of how the coordinate system was chosen or based on the fact that the system looks the same under a rotation or translation.
2. Cancellation, in which vector components cancel due to "matching pairs."

## Example

Identify (a) geometrical and (b) cancellation symmetries to make statements about the electric field in the $x$--$y$ plane that results from two positive point charges at $x=\pm 1$.

**Answer**:

(a) The choice of direction of the $y$--axis was arbitrary. If it was chosen to be downwards, the vector field for $\mathbf{E}$ should be the same as that drawn for the given $y$--axis except flipped up--side down. The reason is that configuration of the charges looks the same if the diagram was flipped. The same argument applies to the $x$--axis. We can conclude that if we draw the vector field for $\mathbf{E}$ in the first quadrant (the region of $x>0$ and $y>0$), symmetry can be used to draw the vector field or field lines in the other three quadrants.

An equivalent way of stating this is to note that if you rotated the system by $180^\circ$ about the $y$--axis, the system will look the same. As a result, if you draw a vector for $x>0$ as shown on the left in the figure below and then rotate your diagram by $180^\circ$, the vector on the rotated diagram (shown on the right) will be correct.

(b) The electric field due to each point charge at an arbitrary point on the $y$--axis is shown below. The $x$--components are equal but in the opposite direction. As a result, $\mathbf{E}$ on the $y$--axis must not have an $x$--component. At the origin, the field due to each charge cancels exactly, so $\mathbf{E}$ should be zero there.

## Example

Identify at least one (a) geometrical and (b) cancellation symmetries that allow us to make statements about the electric field in the $x$--$y$ plane that results from positive point charges a the corners of a square, as shown in the following figure.

**Answer**:

(a) Field must be symmetric about $x$-- and $y$--axis, so only vector field or field lines need to be computed in the first quadrant.

(b) On the $y$--axis, the electric field must have no $x$--component. On the $x$--axis, the electric field must have no $y$--component. At the origin, the field must be zero.

## Problem

Identify at least one (a) geometrical and (b) cancellation symmetries to make statements about the electric field in the $x$--$y$ plane that results from infinite lines of charge that are parallel to the $z$--axis as shown in the following figure. The equation for the electric field due to a line of charge is $\mathbf{E}(s')=2k\lambda \mathbf{\hat{s}}'/s'$, where $s'$ is the perpendicular distance from the line as shown in the diagram.

Use a diagram to justify any statements made for (b).
