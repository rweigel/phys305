# Introduction

A vector field diagram is a plot showing the vectors associated with a vector function at select points in space. 

An example of a vector function from mechanics is 

$$\mathbf{F}(r)=\frac{GMm}{r^2}\boldsymbol{\hat{r}}$$

which has a vector field diagram of

When drawing a vector field diagram, points must be selected where a vector is drawn. The general rule is that just enough points should be selected so that the overall pattern can be discerned such that the reader is able to determine the vectors at points without a vector on the diagram.

Prior to solving the problems in this tutorial, read [Vector Fields](

You can experiment with the creation of vector fields using a [GeoGebra app](https://www.geogebra.org/m/QPE4PaDZ).

# Problems

## Radial Field

Outside of a solid sphere of radius $R$ with uniformly distributed charge $Q$, the field is

$$\mathbf{E}(r)=kQ\frac{1}{r^2}\boldsymbol{\hat{r}}$$

inside, it is

$$\mathbf{E}(r)=kQ\frac{r}{R^3}\boldsymbol{\hat{r}}$$

Sketch the vector field $\mathbf{E}/(kQ)$ inside and outside of the sphere.

## Fields in Cartesian and Cylindrical Coordinates

Plot the vector $\mathbf{A}=\cos\phi\xhat + \sin\phi\yhat$ at the points shown in the following diagram.

Plot the vector $\mathbf{A}=-\sin\phi\xhat + \cos\phi\yhat$ at the points shown in the following diagram.

## Fields in Cartesian Coordinates

Plot the vector $\displaystyle\mathbf{A}=\frac{x}{r}\xhat + \frac{y}{r}\yhat$ at the points shown in the following diagram.

Plot the vector $\displaystyle\mathbf{A}=-\frac{y}{r}\xhat + \frac{x}{r}\yhat$ at the points shown in the following diagram.


## Fields in Cylindrical Coordinates

## Two Masses

Two masses, each of mass $M$ and radius $R$ are located at $\pm 10R$. The total forcee on a mass of mass $m$ is

$$\mathbf{F}(r)=G\frac{Mm}{r^2}\boldsymbol{\hat{r}}$$

in the $z=0$ plane, plot vectors at the points shown in the diagram.
