This HW covers 5.2 and 5.3 of Griffiths.

# Two current sheets

In the following figure, the cross--section of two planes is shown. The planes are infinite in extent in the $\pm z$ direction and $w\gg t$, so they are infinite in extent in the $\pm x$ direction.

On the red plane, the surface current density is $\mathbf{K}=K_o\zhat$, so that current flows out of the page.
On the blue, plane the surface current density is $\mathbf{K}=-K_o\zhat$, so that current flows into the page.

The Amperian loop to be used in part 3. of this problem is shown as a dotted line.

1. Find $\mathbf{B}$ using the equation for the magnetic field due to a large flat current sheet (Equation 5.58 of Griffiths 4th Edition) and superposition.
2. Plot $B_x(y)$ in the range $-2t\le y\le 2t$.
3. Show that $\oint \mathbf{B}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_o I_{encl}$ is satisfied for the Amperian loop shown.

# Long solid cylindrical wire

The cross--section of a long and solid cylindrical wire is shown in the following figure. The wire is infinite in extent in the $\pm z$ direction. A constant current density per unit area of $J_o$ flows along the wire in the $+z$ direction. (The total current flowing along the wire is the integral of $J_o$ over the cross--section shown.)

An Amperian loop of radius $s$ is shown as a dotted line.

1. Find $I_{encl}(s)$ by the Amperian loop for $s\le R$ and $s\ge R$.
2. It can be shown that the magnetic field is

  $\displaystyle\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu_oJ}{2}s\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}$ for $s\le R$

  $\displaystyle\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi s}\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}$ for $s\ge R$

3. Sketch the [vector field](vector_fields.html) for this magnetic field; plot vectors at $s=R/2$ and $s=2R$ for $\phi=0, \pi/2, \pi, 3\pi/2$. (A total of 8 vectors. The relative sizes of the vectors should be correct.)

4. Show that $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l}=\mu_oI_{enc}$ is satisfied for $s\le R$ and $s\ge R$.

5. Show that $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\bfcdot\mathbf{B}=0$ is satisfied for $s\le R$ and $s\ge R$.

6. Show that $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_o\mathbf{J}$ is satisfied for $s\le R$ and $s\ge R$.
