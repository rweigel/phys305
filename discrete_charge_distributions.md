To simplify notation, define \(\epsilon^2 \equiv d^2/(y^2+z^2)\) and \(r^2\equiv y^2+z^2\) and then show \(V(y,z)\) can be written as

$$V(y,z) = \frac{kq}{\sqrt{y^2+(z-d)^2}} = \frac{kq}{\sqrt{y^2+z^2}}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2(z/r)\epsilon + \epsilon^2}}$$

Note that the maximum value of \(|z/r|\) is 1, so \(2(z/r)\epsilon\) is small because \(\epsilon << 1\).
