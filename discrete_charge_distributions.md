# Discrete Charge Distributions

# Problem

In the left part of the previous diagram, the 9 positive charges are uniformly spaced. If the distance between $q_1$ and $q_9$ is $6a$ and the open circle is a perpendicular distance $2a$ above the horizontal line, what is

# Problem

\(q\) is located at \((x,y,z) = (0,0,1)\); \(Q\) is located \((x,y,z) = (0,1,0)\).  The force of \(q\) on \(Q\) is \(\mathbf{F}_{qQ} = \frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_0}(a\hat{\mathbf{x}} + b\hat{\mathbf{y}} + c\hat{\mathbf{z}})\).  What are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)?  What is \(F\) (or \(|\mathbf{F}|\))?

Use the formula \(F = kqQ/d^2\) to check your answer and signs.

# Problem

Charge \(2q\) is located at \((x,y,z)\)=\((0,2d,2d)\). Charge \(3q\) is located at \((x,y,z)\)=\((0,-3d,-3d)\). Compute the electric field due to these charges at \((d,0,0)\).
