# Topics

This course covers the topics in Chapters 1-7 of the [textbook](#textbook).

The catalog description is

> [Physics 305 Electromagnetic Theory](https://catalog.gmu.edu/search/?search=PHYS+305)
>
> Interaction of static charges, interaction of stationary currents, electromagnetic induction, and Maxwell's equations.
>
> Required Prerequisites: PHYS 260<sup>C</sup> and PHYS 301<sup>*</sup>.
>
> <sup>C</sup> Requires minimum grade of C.
>
><sup>*</sup> May be taken concurrently.

# Format of Course

The delivery of this course is centered on tutorials that introduce topics, provide examples, and require you to solve problems related to the examples. In general, I will not have a formal lecture prepared.

1. Most of what I would normally lecture on has been written into the tutorials and their examples.
2. I have done this to maximize the amount of time available for students to ask question during class.
3. **If you do not work on the tutorials before class, you will not find class attendance helpful.**

# Discord

The first week of class, you should have received an email inviting you to join a Discord server. I will use Discord to answer questions.

# Succeeding in this Course

For many, this may be your first junior/senior-level physics course.  To succeed, you may need to change the way you study. In addition to what is written below, please see [Joe Weingartner's PHYS 303 syllabus](http://physics.gmu.edu/~joe/PHYS303/syllabus.pdf) for his perspective and Feynman's [Never forget an idea again](https://www.scotthyoung.com/learnonsteroids/grab/TranscriptFeynman.pdf).

Success in this course depends primarily on two factors, in order of importance:

1. How many problems you solved "the right way" (I will discuss this in class)
2. How much you discussed problems and concepts with others

Consistent with 1., nearly every concept is followed by an example and then a problem that you are expected to solve to determine if you understood the explanation of the concept and the example.

> It is easy to find solved physics problems. Reading their solution before thinking about them is about as useful as learning to play basketball by watching a video. If you aren't confident that you can solve a problem, attempt to solve it without the use of the solution and compare your solution with a classmate's _before_ looking at the solution.

How to read:

* Read an explanation of a topic and fill in the missing steps.
* Close the book or web page and attempt to repeat the explanation. Check your answer. If you got it wrong, re-visit the problem a day later.
* If you are successful, attempt to re-solve the problem differently (for example, using a different coordinate system or using Gauss' Law instead of Coulomb's law, etc.). Check answer. If you got it wrong, re-visit problem a day later. Keep a separate notebook with a list of things you had issues with and how you resolved them.

%I learned quite a bit about how to think like a professional physicist from my advisor in graduate school. Anytime I would bring up a concept, he would start from first principles, set up a geometry, do dimensional analysis, and write down facts that he knew. Then he would repeat my question to me and attempt to answer it. Doing this repeately serves two purposes (1) It cements in the fundamental concepts by repeating them often and (2) gets you thinking about the fundamentals. I oftentimes rely on this approach when a student asks me about a problem on a physics-related topic that have not thought about for many years.

%To succeed in physics, you should do the same. Use Google and/or a textbook only after you have written down everything you know and attempted to solve a problem with what you wrote down as a starting point. In addition, think about symmetry, dimensions, and related problems that you know how to solve and can use to check your answer by taking a limit. I'll give many examples of this throughout the semester, but related to the last point, if you are given a 2-D problem, try to solve a simpler or 1-D problem for which you know the answer. Then try the more complex or 2-D problem. You probably happen to remember that the electric field falls off like $1/r$ for an infinite line of charge. It has to fall off more slowly than $1/r^2$, and you should know that Coulomb's Law depends on $1/r^2$. If asked to calculate the field for a finite line of charge, first see if you can calculate the equation for the 1/r dependence. Then try the finite line problem - the equation will be a bit more complicated, but having solved the 1/r problem, you will have a prepped yourself. As another example, if asked to compute the field associated with a finite sheet of charge, compute the field for a finite line of charge first, check that your answer is correct in the limit that the line is long, and then try the sheet problem.

%I will be giving you tips like this throughout the semester. Force yourself to follow the problem-solving approaches that I suggest. Many students have a problem-solving approach from freshman/sophomore physics that won't work for more advanced courses (for example, relying on memory instead of relying on your ability to solve a problem by building up from a few basic principles that you have memorized).


# Grading

Your grade for this course has two components:

1. Homework average (30%) - approximately one per week
2. Exam average (70%) - one midterm and one final, equally weighted

Because of the size of this class, I may not grade all problems on every homework assignment. You score is based only on the problems selected for grading.

There will be two exams during the semester and a cumulative final exam. The exams carry equal weight.

The midterm will cover Chapters 1-3 of Griffiths

The final exam will cover Chapters 4-6 of Griffiths

The nominal percentage-to-letter grade conversion is (this is subject to change such that the required percentage score for a given letter grade is lower)

* &gt; 97: A+; 93 to 96.<span style="text-decoration:overline">9</span>: A-; 90 to 92.<span style="text-decoration:overline">9</span>: A-

# Textbook

I will follow the outline of the topics covered in chapters 1-6 (and 7, if time) in [Introduction to Electrodynamics (4th Edition) by David J. Griffiths](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Electrodynamics-4th-David-Griffiths/dp/0321856562). Note that the 3rd Edition is also widely available. You may buy either edition. However, I will reference pages and problem numbers from 4th edition.

# Suggested References

The following references may be used as additional study aids. They have been listed in order of importance/usefulness.

[Electricity and Magnetism (3rd Edition) by Edward M. Purcell and David J. Morin](https://www.amazon.com/Electricity-Magnetism-Edward-M-Purcell/dp/1107014026/) covers the same topics as Griffiths at the same level.  If you are looking for an alternative explanation, this textbook will be helpful.  The book contains far more examples, discussion, and content than Griffiths.  It also includes solutions.  

[Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electromagnetics by Joseph A. Edminister](http://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-Electromagnetics-4th-Outlines/dp/0071831479/) is a great reference for problems with full solutions and summaries of topics.

[Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus (4th Edition) by H. M. Schey](https://www.amazon.com/Div-Grad-Curl-All-That/dp/0393925161/) is an excellent reference for the mathematical background that you need to understand for this course. The book contains a concise and clear review of topics that are covered in a vector calculus course (usually "Calculus III").

[A Student's Guide to Maxwell's Equations (1st Edition) by Daniel Fleisch](https://www.amazon.com/Students-Guide-Maxwells-Equations/dp/0521701473/) notes that "the focus is exclusively on Maxwell’s Equations, which means you won’t have to wade through hundreds of pages of related topics to get to the essential concepts. This leaves room for in-depth explanations of the most relevant features, such as the difference between charge-based and induced electric fields, the physical meaning of divergence and curl, and the usefulness of both the integral and differential forms of each equation." A web page with detailed solutions to problems is available at http://www.danfleisch.com/maxwell/.

[The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Mainly Electromagnetism and Matter, Volume 2, 1977](https://www.amazon.com/Feynman-Lectures-Physics-Mainly-Electromagnetism/dp/020102117X/) contains excellent lecture-style presentations on Electricity and Magnetism.  The full volume is available [online](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_toc.html).

[Yale Lectures on Physics II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD07B2225BB40E582&feature=plcp ) is a lecture series on topics typically covered in a second-semester physics course and does not cover the mathematics at the level required for this course.  These videos may be useful as a review.

[8.07 Class Notes by John Belcher](http://web.mit.edu/viz/soft/visualizations/IntermediateE&M/classNotes_2010_final.pdf) covers the same topics as Griffiths and has additional examples.
