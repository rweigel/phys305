# Discrete Charge Distributions

Two point charges $q$ are located at $x=\pm b$.

1. Find $\mathbf{E}$ on the $x$--axis in terms of $k$, $q$, $b$, and cartesian coordinates and unit vectors.
2. For $x\gg b$, write an equation for $\mathbf{E}$ in the form

   $\displaystyle \mathbf{E}=\left[B_o+\frac{B_1}{x} + \frac{B_2}{x^2} + \frac{B_3}{x^3}\right]\xhat$
   
   by using the binomial expansion formula with your answer from 1. The values for $B_0, ..., B_3$, if non--zero, should be written in terms of $k$, $q$, and $b$. The binomial expansion formula to first order in $\delta$ is $1/(1+\delta)^n\simeq 1-n\delta$, which applies for $\delta \ll 1$.
3. State at least one check that you made of your answer to 2.
   
# Charge Densities

## Solid cylinder

A solid cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L$ has a charge of $+3Q$ uniformly distributed within it. The blue Gaussian cylinder shown has the same center line as the solid cylinder, length $l$, and radius $s$.

1. Find the volume charge density of the charged cylinder and its charge per unit length.

2. Find an equation that relates $Q_{encl}$, the charge inside the Gaussian cylinder, and $s$. Draw a plot of $Q_{encl}$ vs $s$.

## Solid Sphere

A solid sphere of radius $R$ that is centered on the origin has a charge density of $\rho(r)=\rho_o r^2/R^2$.

Compute and plot the charge enclosed in a Gaussian sphere centered on the origin versus the radius of the Gaussian sphere.

# Continuous Charge Distributions I

A line of charge with uniform charge density of $\lambda_o$ extends from $0$ to $L$ on the $x$-axis, where $L>0$.

Follow and show the steps given in the notes and find $\mathbf{E}$ on the $x$--axis for $x>L$ in terms of one or more of $k,\lambda_o,L,x,$ and cartesian coordinates and unit vectors.

# Continuous Charge Distributions II

A uniformly charged disk of radius $R$ with a total charge $Q$ is in the $x$--$y$ plane and centered on the origin.

Follow and show the steps given in the notes and find $\mathbf{E}$ on the $z$--axis in terms of one or more of $k,Q,R,z$, and cartesian unit vectors.

# Extra Credit

A line of charge in the $x$-$y$ plane has a uniform charge density of $\lambda_o$, passes through the origin, is at an angle of $\phi$ with the $x$-axis, and extends from $x=-b$ to $x=b$.

Find $\mathbf{E}$ on the $y$--axis using two two methods:

1. By following the steps in the notes.
2. Transforming the equation for $\mathbf{E}(y)$ given in the notes for a line of charge on the $x$--axis between $x=-L$ and $x=L$ to coordinate system rotated by $\phi$ about the $z$--axis.
