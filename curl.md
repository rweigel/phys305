The electrostatic curl equation in integral form

$$\oint\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l} =0$$

Graphically this means ...

From either of the last two, it follows that the electric field can be written as a gradient of a scalar function, which we call the electric potential

$$\mathbf{E}=-\nabla V$$

Explicitly, this is

$$V=...$$

Graphically this means ...

This gives us an alternative way of computing the electric field. First compute \(V\) and then take its gradient to find \(\mathbf{E}\). In practice, it is often faster to use this equation than to use Coulomb's Law for the electrostatic field.
