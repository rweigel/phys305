# Force on Current Loop

% Copied to notes

A current loop with a radius of $b$ is parallel to the $x-y$ plane and centered on $z=d$. The current in the loop is  $I$.

<img src="figures/Lorentz_Force_Shifted_Ring.svg"/>

There is an external magnetic field of 

$$\mathbf{B}_{ext}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

(This field is due to a magnetic dipole at the origin.)

1. What is $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ at $(x,y,z)=(b,0,d)$?
2. Explain why the net force on the loop will be in the  $z$ direction. (Note: earlier had $-z$ typo.)
2. If the loop is flexible, will it tend to compress or expand?
2. Compute the net force (magnitude and direction) on the loop. Your answer should be in terms of  $\mu_o$,  $I$,  $m_o$,  $b$, and  $d$. It may help to draw the loop as viewed from a point above with vectors indicating the direction of $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ and the associated force.

Note that the loop shown will create a magnetic field. However, when computing the force on the loop, the field due to the loop is omitted, and only $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ is used. The reason is the same reason that when you compute the force on an object in mechanics, you only use the force due to the gravitational field of Earth. Although each part of the object exerts a gravitational force on the other parts of the object, the net "self--force" is zero.

1\. At this point (and actually any point on the wire), $\cos\theta=d/r$ and $\sin\theta=b/r$, where $r=\sqrt{b^2+d^2}$. Substitution gives

$\displaystyle\mathbf{B}_{ext}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{(b^2+d^2)^2}\left(2d\hat{\mathbf{r}}+b\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$

2\. From part (c) of the figure above, at any point on the wire, the field has components in $+s$ and $+z$ directions (for small enough $\theta$). The cross product of $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ with $\mathbf{I}$, which is into the page in the view of part (c), gives a $+\zhat$ force.

3\. The cross product $\mathbf{B}=B_z\zhat$ with $\mathbf{I}$ gives a force in the $-\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ direction on each element of the wire. This force tends to compress the wire. The sum of the forces over the differential element is zero. (If you compress a ball, you are applying a force to each element on the surface, but the net force is zero because the ball does not accelerate.)

4\. The easiest way to solve this is to write $\mathbf{B}\_{ext}$ with cylindrical unit vectors (given that $\mathbf{I}$ was written with a cylindrical unit vector and we need to compute $\mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{B}\_{ext}$). 

The given field is
$\mathbf{B}_{ext}=B_o(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \sin\theta\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}})$, where $B_o\equiv\mu_o m_o/4\pi r^3$ and $r$, $\sin\theta$, and $\cos\theta$ are given in the answer to part 1.

To write $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ in cylindrical coordinates, one can use a diagram to show that

$\hat{\mathbf{r}}=\cos\theta\zhat + \sin\theta\hat{\mathbf{s}}$

$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}=-\sin\theta\zhat + \cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{s}}$

(These formulas are not given on the pages at the end of Griffiths, but they can be derived from the given formulas. However, you should also be able to derive them using a diagram.)

Substitution gives

$\displaystyle\frac{\mathbf{B}_{ext}}{B_o}=(3\cos^2\theta-1)\zhat + 3\cos\theta\sin\theta\mathbf{\hat{s}}$

(Earlier, I noted that for small enough $\theta$, $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ has a $+z$ component. From this equation, we can see that the requirement for this is $3\cos^2\theta-1 > 1$ or $b\lt \sqrt{2}d$.)

Both components are constant on the loop because $\theta$ is constant. Based on the answers to 2. and 3., we only expect the $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ component of the field to give a _net_ force. Given these two arguments, we can finish the problem by writing $\mathbf{F}=ILB_{ext\text{ }s}\zhat$ with $L=2\pi b$ and $B_{ext\text{ }s}=3\cos\theta\sin\theta$. In the following, details on the math that leads to these conclusions are shown.

We need to evaluate

$\displaystyle \mathbf{F}=\int dl \mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{B}$

From the diagram, $\mathbf{I}=-I\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}$ and $dl=b d\phi$.
The cross product needed for computing the force is

$\mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{B}_{ext}=-IB_o\left((3\cos^2\theta-1)\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}\times\zhat + 3\cos\theta\sin\theta\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}\times\mathbf{\hat{s}}\right)$

Evaluating the unit vector cross products gives

$\mathbf{I}\times \mathbf{B}_{ext}=IB_o(1-3\cos^2\theta)\mathbf{\hat{s}} + 3IB_o\cos\theta\sin\theta\zhat$

We usually would convert $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ to cartesian unit vectors before integration. However, we know that the integral of $d\phi\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ from $0$ to $2\pi$ is zero from a diagram (see discussion in [integrating unit vectors](vectors.html#integrating); we also expect this physically -- if we pick two points on opposite sides of the wire, the force on them in the $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ direction is equal and opposite. As a result, we could drop the $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ term in the cross product at this point. 

Using $dl=b d\phi$ and the cross product computed above, we have

$\displaystyle \mathbf{F}=\int_0^{2\pi} b d\phi IB_o(1-3\cos^2\theta)\mathbf{\hat{s}} + \int_0^{2\pi} b d\phi 3IB_o\cos\theta\sin\theta\zhat$

Factoring out constants gives

$\displaystyle \mathbf{F}= IB_ob(1-3\cos^2\theta)\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi\mathbf{\hat{s}} +  3IB_ob\cos\theta\sin\theta\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi\zhat$

The first integral is zero after using $\hat{\mathbf{s}}=\cos\phi\xhat + \sin\phi\yhat$. The second integral is $2\pi$. We are left with

$\mathbf{F}=I (2\pi b) B_o  3\cos\theta\sin\theta\zhat$

Using $B_o=\mu_o m_o/4\pi r^3$, $\cos\theta=d/r$, $\sin\theta=b/r$, and $r=\sqrt{b^2+d^2}$ gives

$\displaystyle \mathbf{F}=\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIdb^2}{(b^2+d^2)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$

# Biot-Savart for Straight Wire

% Copied to notes

1. Find $\mathbf{B}$ at the origin due to the rectangular current loop shown in the following figure. (The loop is centered on the origin.)
2. If $a$ is increased while $b$ is fixed, such that $a\gg b$, we expect the field at the origin to be approximately the field due to infinitely long wires at $y=b/2$ and $y=-b/2$. Compute $\mathbf{B}$ at the origin using this assumption. You may do this by taking your answer from 1. and applying the limit $a\gg b$ or by simply using the formula for the field due to a long straight wire in introductory textbooks.

**Answer**

1\. Griffiths gives the equation $B=\frac{\mu_o I}{4\pi s}(\sin\theta_2-\sin\theta_1)$. This equation can be applied to the given problem. For the bottom wire, the initial angle is $\sin\theta_1=a/\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ and the final angle is $\sin\theta_2=-a/\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. Therefore,

Bottom: $\displaystyle B_z=\frac{\mu_o I}{4\pi (b/2)}\frac{-2a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}=-\frac{\mu_o I}{\pi b}\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$ 

The top wire contributes the same field as the bottom, so.

Top: $\displaystyle B_z=-\frac{\mu_o I}{\pi b}\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$ 

The field for the left and right wire can be found by swapping $a$ and $b$ in the above equation.

Left: $\displaystyle B_z=-\frac{\mu_o I}{\pi a}\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$ 

Right: $\displaystyle B_z=-\frac{\mu_o I}{\pi a}\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$ 

Griffiths' solution uses a short--cut that applies to this particular problem. In class, I encouraged you to solve this problem using the more general method, which is as follows.

$\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{0}$

$\mathbf{r}'=x'\xhat + y'\yhat=x'\xhat -(b/2)\yhat$

$d\mathbf{l}' = -dx'\xhat$

Substitution of the above into

$\displaystyle \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\int\frac{d\mathbf{l}'\times (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|^3}$

Gives

$\displaystyle \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\int\frac{-dx'\xhat\times (-x'\xhat + (b/2)\yhat)}{\left(x'^2 + (b/2)^2\right)^{3/2}}$

After evaluating the cross products, we are left with

$\displaystyle \mathbf{B} = -\zhat\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{Ib}{2}\int_{-a/2}^{a/2}\frac{dx'}{\left(x'^2 + (b/2)^2\right)^{3/2}}$

Let $x'=(b/2)\tan u$, then $dx'=b du/2\cos^2u$ and the integrand is

$\displaystyle\frac{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)\frac{du}{\cos^2u}}{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^3(\tan^2u+1)^{3/2}}$

Dividing $\sin^2u+\cos^2u=1$ by $\cos^2u$ gives $\tan^2u+1=1/\cos^2u$, so the integrand can be written

$\displaystyle\frac{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)\frac{du}{\cos^2u}}{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^3|1/\cos u|^3}=\left(\frac{2}{b}\right)^2|\cos u|du$

The limits of integration are from $u_o=\tan^{-1}(-a/b)$ to $u_f=\tan^{-1}(a/b)$

$\displaystyle \mathbf{B} = -\zhat\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{I2}{b}\int_{u_o}^{u_f}|\cos u|du$

Within these limits of integration, $\cos u$ is positive<sup>\*</sup>, so we can drop the absolute value and integrate. (<sup>\*</sup>this requires some thought and a diagram to show.)

$\displaystyle \mathbf{B} = -\zhat\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{I2}{b}(\sin u_f-\sin u_o)$

If $u_o=\tan^{-1}(-a/b)$, then $\tan u_o=-a/b$. This corresponds to a right triangle in the fourth quadrant with sides of $a$ and $b$, which has a hypotenuse of $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ and for which $\sin u_o = -a/\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. Similarly, $\sin u_f = a/\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. Substitution gives

$\displaystyle \mathbf{B} = -\zhat\frac{\mu_oI}{b}\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$

2\. For an infinite wire, $B=\mu_o I/2\pi s$, where $s$ is the perpendicular distance from the wire; the magnitude is determined from the right--hand rule. The top and bottom wires will create a field with this magnitude in the $-\zhat$ direction (from the right-hand rule). For both wires, the perpendicular distance is $b/2$. Therefore, $B_z=-2\mu_o I/\pi b$.

The field from the top and bottom wires from part 1. is

$\displaystyle B_z=-\frac{2\mu_o I}{\pi b}\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$

Factoring out $a$ gives

$\displaystyle B_z=-\frac{2\mu_o I}{\pi b}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+b^2/a^2}}$

For $b \lt a$, we can expand

$\displaystyle B_z = -\frac{2\mu_o I}{\pi b}\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\frac{b^2}{a^2}+...\right)$

For $a\gg b$,

$\displaystyle B_z \simeq -\frac{2\mu_o I}{\pi b}$

# Biot-Savart for Curved Wire

% Copied to notes

A segment of a closed current loop is shown in the following figure. Compute the magnetic field at the center of the semi--circle due to the straight and curved segments shown.

<img src="figures/Lorentz_Force_Law_Hemisphere.svg"/>

(Technically, to use the Biot--Savart law for currents in a wire, the current must be constant, and the wire must form a closed loop. As a result, there will be a contribution to the magnetic field at the origin due to the parts of the closed loop that are not shown. However, here we assume that the not--shown part of the loop is far enough away that they can be neglected.)

**Answer**

For the magnitude, one can use 1/2 of equation 5.41 of Griffiths with $z=0$. The direction can be determined from the right-hand rule. (Equation 5.41 is for a circular loop offset in the $z$ direction.)

If the origin is the center of the circle, $x$ is up, and $y$ is to the right, then $\mathbf{I}=I\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$, $dl'=Rd\phi'$, $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{0}$, and $\mathbf{r}'=R\hat{\mathbf{s}}$. Substitution of these into

$\displaystyle \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int dl'\frac{\mathbf{I}\times (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|^3}$

gives

$\displaystyle \mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}Rd\phi' \frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times (-R\hat{\mathbf{s}})}{R^3}=\zhat\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{1}{R}\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}d\phi'=\frac{\mu_oI}{4R}\zhat$

# Extra Credit

% Copied to notes

Find $\mathbf{B}(z)$ for the previous problem, where the $z$--axis passes through the center of the semi--circle and is perpendicular to the page. Assume positive $z$ is out of the page.

**Comments**

The contributions from the straight segments can be found using 

$\displaystyle B=\frac{\mu_o I}{4\pi s}(\sin\theta_2-\sin\theta_1)$

and a diagram to determine $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$.

The contribution from the semi--circle can be found using 1/2 of equation 5.41 of Griffiths.
