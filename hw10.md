# Force on Current Loop

A current loop with a radius of $b$ is parallel to the $x-y$ plane and centered on $z=d$. The current in the loop is  $I$.

<img src="figures/Lorentz_Force_Shifted_Ring.svg"/>

There is an external magnetic field of 

$$\mathbf{B}_{ext}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^3}\left(2\cos\theta\hat{\mathbf{r}}+\sin\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)$$

(This field is due to a magnetic dipole at the origin.)

1. What is $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ at $(x,y,z)=(b,0,d)$?
2. Explain why the net force on the loop will be in the  $-\mathbf{z} $ direction.
2. If the loop is flexible, will it tend to compress or expand?
2. Compute the net force (magnitude and direction) on the loop. Your answer should be in terms of  $\mu_o$,  $I$,  $m_o$,  $b$, and  $d$. It may help to draw the loop as viewed from a point above with vectors indicating the direction of $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ and the associated force.

Note that the loop shown will create a magnetic field. However, when computing the force on the loop, the field due to the loop is omitted, and only $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ is used. The reason is the same reason that when you compute the force on an object in mechanics, you only use the force due to the gravitational field of Earth. Although each part of the object exerts a gravitational force on the other parts of the object, the net "self--force" is zero.

%In class, I discussed one approach, which was to compute the horizontal,  $B_s $, and vertical,  $B_z $, magnetic field at all points on the loop. Then compute the horizontal and vertical forces created by these two fields individually.  $B_s $ results in a vertical force on a differential element  $dl $ of  $-IdlB_s\hat{\mathbf{z}} $.  $B_z $ results in a horizontal force of  $IdlB_z\hat{\mathbf{s}} $.  The horizontal force averages to zero. The total vertical force is obtained by using  $dl=bd\phi $ and integrating

%$$\int_0^{2\pi}-IB_sbd\phi\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

%One should make sure you can reproduce the force diagram that I drew on the board to show this.

%The magnitude of horizontal field is  $B_s=\sqrt{B_x^2+B_y^2} $ and  $B_x $ and  $B_y $ were found in a previous problem. Neither depend on  $\phi $. The result is

%$$B_s(x,y)=\sqrt{B_x^2+B_y^2}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{3m_oz}{r^5}\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$

%On the loop,  $z=d $,  $x^2+y^2=b^2 $, and  $r^2=b^2+d^2 $. Putting this all together gives a net force of

%$$\mathbf{F}=-\frac{3}{2}\frac{\mu_om_oIdb^2}{(b^2+d^2)^{5/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

%The other way to solve this is to use

%$$\mathbf{F} = \int Id\mathbf{l}\times \mathbf{B}$$

%at the start. In contrast, in the previous solution, I used the scalar version of this equation " $IdlB $" by writing  $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}_s+\mathbf{B}_z $ and addressed the force from each component "B" separately. To use  $\mathbf{F} = \int Id\mathbf{l}\times \mathbf{B} $ more directly, use 

%$$d\mathbf{l}=bd\phi\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}=bd\phi(-\sin\phi\hat{\mathbf{x}}+\cos\phi\hat{\mathbf{y}})$$

%and

%$$\mathbf{B}=B_x\hat{\mathbf{x}}+B_y\hat{\mathbf{y}}+B_z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

%With the cartesian components of  $\mathbf{B} $ from a previous problem. The cross product will result in a vector with components in all three cartesian directions. The integrals associated with the  $x $ and  $y $ direction evaluate to zero.

# Biot-Savart for Straight Wire

1. Find $\mathbf{B}$ at the origin due to the rectangular current loop shown in the following figure. (The loop is centered on the origin.)
2. If $a$ is increased while $b$ is fixed, such that $a\gg b$, we expect the field at the origin to be approximately the field due to infinitely long wires at $y=b/2$ and $y=-b/2$. Compute $\mathbf{B}$ at the origin using this assumption. You may do this by taking your answer from 1. and applying the limit $a\gg b$ or by simply using the formula for the field due to a long straight wire in introductory textbooks.

# Biot-Savart for Curved Wire

A segment of a closed current loop is shown in the following figure. Compute the magnetic field at the center of the semi--circle due to the straight and curved segments shown.

(Technically, to use the Biot--Savart law for currents in a wire, the current must be constant, and the wire must form a closed loop. As a result, there will be a contribution to the magnetic field at the origin due to the parts of the closed loop that are not shown. However, here we assume that the not--shown part of the loop is far enough away that they can be neglected.)
