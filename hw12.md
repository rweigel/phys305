This HW covers [Vector Potential](vector_potential.html), which is covered in Chapters 5.4 Griffiths, and magnetic fields in matter, which is covered in Chapter 6 of Griffiths. See also [Magnetic Dipoles](magnetic_dipoles.html), [Magnetization](magnetization.html), [Continuous Magnetic Dipole Distributions](continuous_magnetic_dipole_distributions.html), and [Induced Magnetization](induced_magnetization.html).

I strongly advise you to work on the first three problems before class on Tuesday, November 23rd. 

# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

If $\mathbf{A}= \alpha\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$, where $\alpha$ is a constant, what is $\mathbf{B}$?

% Answer: See 5.24 of Griffiths

# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

If $\mathbf{A} = -\alpha y \zhat$ for $y\gt 0$ and $\mathbf{A} = +\alpha y \zhat$ for $y\lt 0$, where $\alpha$ is a constant,

1. find $\mathbf{B}$ and
2. plot $B_x(y)$.
3. Based on the plot for 2., what is the current system that produced this $\mathbf{B}$?

%**Answer**

%$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{\partial A_z }{\partial y} - \frac{\partial A_y }{\partial z} \right)\xhat +  \left(\frac{\partial A_x }{\partial z} - \frac{\partial A_z }{\partial x} \right)\yhat +  \left(\frac{\partial A_y }{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x }{\partial y} \right)\zhat $

%$A_x=0$, $A_y=0$, and $A_z=\mp \alpha y$

%Inserting zeros for terms involving partial derivative of $A_x$ and $A_y$ gives

%$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{\partial A_z }{\partial y} - 0 \right)\xhat +  \left(0 - \frac{\partial A_z }{\partial x} \right)\yhat +  \left(0 + 0\right)\zhat $

%Evaluation gives

%$\mathbf{B} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \mp\alpha\xhat$

%This is the field of a sheet of current in the $x$--$y$ plane with current flowing in the $+\zhat$ direction.

# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

The general equation for the vector potential for a magnetic dipole is

$$\mathbf{A}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{m}\times\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$$

If $\mathbf{m}=m_o\xhat$, find $\mathbf{B}$ in cartesian coordinates with cartesian unit vectors. Note that you can check your answer using equation 5.89 of Griffiths 4th edition:

$$\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{1}{r^3}\left[3(\mathbf{m}\bfcdot\hat{\mathbf{r}})\hat{\mathbf{r}} - \mathbf{m}\right]$$

# (Extra credit) Computing $\mathbf{A}$

For a segment of wire that extends from $-L/2$ to $L/2$ on the $z$--axis with a current that flows in the $+z$ direction, find $\mathbf{A}(x)$.

%https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+1%2Fsqrt%28a%5E2%2Bx%5E2%29

%Let $u=xz'$, then

%$\displaystyle\mathbf{A}=\zhat\frac{\mu_oI}{4\pi}\frac{x}{|x|}\int_{-L/2x}^{L/2x} \frac{du}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}$

%$\displaystyle\int_{u_f}^{u_o}\frac{du}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}=\sinh^{-1}(u)\Big|\_{u_f}^{u_o}=\ln(\sqrt{u^2+1}+1)\Big|_{u_f}^{u_o}$

%tanh^(-1)(x/sqrt(a^2 + x^2)) + constant

# $\mathbf{B}$ Due to a Long Magnetized Solid Cylinder I.

A long solid cylinder of radius $R$ has a magnetization $\mathbf{M}=M_o\zhat$. The cylinder is centered on the origin and aligned with the $z$--axis.

1. Find the bound currents $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$.
2. Find $\mathbf{B}_b(s)$, which is the magnetic field due to the bound current densities found in part 1. of this problem.

# $\mathbf{B}$ Due to a Long Magnetized Solid Cylinder II.

A long cylinder of radius $R$ has a magnetization of $\mathbf{M}=(M_os/R)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$. The cylinder is centered on the origin and aligned with the $z$--axis.

1. Find the bound currents $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$.
2. Find $\mathbf{B}_b(s)$, which is the magnetic field due to the bound current densities found in part 1. of this problem.

# Induced Magnetization

A long solid cylinder of inner radius $R_i$ and outer radius $R_o$ has a magnetic susceptibility of $\chi_m$ and is initially unmagnetized. The cylinder is centered on the origin and aligned with the $z$--axis.

There is an external magnetic field of $\displaystyle\mathbf{B}_{ext}=\frac{\mu_oI_{ext}}{2\pi s}\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ that is created by a wire that runs along the $z$ axis.

The total field is given by $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}\_{ext} + \mathbf{B}_{b}$, where $\mathbf{B}_b$ is the field due to $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$, which are induced by the external magnetic field. 

It can be shown that $\mathbf{B}=(1+\chi_m)\mathbf{B}\_{ext}$ for $R_i\lt s\lt R_o$ and $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ for $s\lt R_i$ and $s\gt R_o$. That is, inside the cylinder, the material modifies the external field by a factor of $1+\chi_m$ and outside, the field is the same as it would be if the cylinder was not present.

This result was found using the assumption that the induced magnetization was related to the total field $\mathbf{B}$ according to

$$\mathbf{M}=\frac{\chi_m}{\mu_o(1+\chi_m)}\mathbf{B}$$

1. Find $\mathbf{K}\_b$ on the inner and outer curved surfaces of the cylinder in terms of $\mu\_o$, $\chi_m$, $I\_{ext}$, and $R_o$ or $R_i$
2. Find $\mathbf{J}_b$
2. Show that these bound currents give $\mathbf{B}\_b$ such that $\mathbf{B}\_{ext} + \mathbf{B}_{b}$ matches the equation given form $\mathbf{B}$ for all $s$.

%Let $\chi_m/[(1+\chi_m)\mu_o]=\chi$.

%$B_\phi(s)=\frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi s} + B_\phi^b$

%$\mathbf{M}=\chi\mathbf{B}$

%$\mathbf{M}_\phi=\chi B_\phi$

%$K^b_{z\text{ inner}}=\chi B_\phi(R_i)$

%$K^b_{z\text{ outer}}=-\chi B_\phi(R_o)$

%Enclosed current due to $K^b$ inside material:

%$I^{K_b}_{encl}=2\pi\chi R_i B_\phi(R_i)$

%$J^b_z=\frac{1}{s}\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(sM_\phi(s))=\frac{\chi}{s}\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(sB_\phi(s))$

%Enclosed current due to $J^b$ inside material:

%$I^{J_b}\_{encl}(s)=2\pi\chi\int_{R_i}^s \frac{\chi}{s'}\frac{\partial}{\partial s'}(s'B_\phi(s')) s' ds'$

%Ampere's law

%$2\pi s B^b_\phi = \mu_oI^b_{encl}$

%gives

%$B^b_\phi=\mu_o\chi B_\phi=\frac{\chi_m}{1+\chi_m}B_\phi$

%$B_\phi(s)=\frac{\mu_oI}{2\pi s} + B_\phi^b$

%gives

%$B_\phi=(1+\chi_m)B_{\phi\text{ }ext}$
