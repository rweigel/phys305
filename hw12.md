Due on Thursday, **December 2nd** at 3:00 pm.

Send your solutions to the email address rweigel+phys305@gmu.edu as a scanned PDF. Use a file name of `Yourlastname_PHYS305_HW12.pdf` (one file only, please). Capitalize the first letter in your last name and use caps and underscores as indicated. Include your name on the first sheet. (+1 on this HW if you followed these directions exactly.)

This HW covers [Vector Potential](vector_potential.html), which is covered in Chapters 5.4 Griffiths, and magnetic fields in matter, which is covered in Chapter 6 of Griffiths. I'll post notes for Chapter 6 next week.

I strongly advise you to work on the first three problems before class on Tuesday, November 23rd. 

# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

If $\mathbf{A}= \alpha\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$, where $\alpha$ is a constant, what is $\mathbf{B}$?

% Answer: See 5.24 of Griffiths

# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

If $\mathbf{A} = -\alpha y \zhat$ for $y\gt 0$ and $\mathbf{A} = +\alpha y \zhat$ for $y\lt 0$, where $\alpha$ is a constant,

1. find $\mathbf{B}$ and
2. plot $B_x(y)$.
3. Based on the plot for 2., what is the current system that produced this $\mathbf{B}$?

%**Answer**

%$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{\partial A_z }{\partial y} - \frac{\partial A_y }{\partial z} \right)\xhat +  \left(\frac{\partial A_x }{\partial z} - \frac{\partial A_z }{\partial x} \right)\yhat +  \left(\frac{\partial A_y }{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x }{\partial y} \right)\zhat $

%$A_x=0$, $A_y=0$, and $A_z=\mp \alpha y$

%Inserting zeros for terms involving partial derviatives of $A_x$ and $A_y$ gives

%$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{\partial A_z }{\partial y} - 0 \right)\xhat +  \left(0 - \frac{\partial A_z }{\partial x} \right)\yhat +  \left(0 + 0\right)\zhat $

%Evaluation gives

%$\mathbf{B} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \mp\alpha\xhat$

%This is the field of a sheet of current in the $x$--$y$ plane with current flowing in the $+\zhat$ direction.

# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

The general equation for the vector potential for a magnetic dipole is

$$\mathbf{A}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{m}\times\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$$

If $\mathbf{m}=m_o\xhat$, find $\mathbf{B}$ in cartesian coordinates with cartesian unit vectors. Note that you can check your answer using equation 5.89 of Griffiths 4th edition:

$$\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{1}{r^3}\left[3(\mathbf{m}\bfcdot\hat{\mathbf{r}})\hat{\mathbf{r}} - \mathbf{m}\right]$$

# (Extra credit) Computing $\mathbf{A}$

For a segment of wire that extends from $-L/2$ to $L/2$ on the $z$--axis with a current that flows in the $+z$ direction, find $\mathbf{A}(x)$.

%https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+1%2Fsqrt%28a%5E2%2Bx%5E2%29

%Let $u=xz'$, then

%$\displaystyle\mathbf{A}=\zhat\frac{\mu_oI}{4\pi}\frac{x}{|x|}\int_{-L/2x}^{L/2x} \frac{du}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}$

%$\displaystyle\int_{u_f}^{u_o}\frac{du}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}=\sinh^{-1}(u)\Big|\_{u_f}^{u_o}=\ln(\sqrt{u^2+1}+1)\Big|_{u_f}^{u_o}$

%tanh^(-1)(x/sqrt(a^2 + x^2)) + constant
