# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

If $\mathbf{A}= \alpha\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$, where $\alpha$ is a constant, what is $\mathbf{B}$?

**Answer**

The curl of a vector $\mathbf{A}$ in spherical coordinates is

$\displaystyle\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} =
{\frac {1}{r\sin \theta }}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}\left(A_{\phi }\sin \theta \right)
-
{\frac {\partial A_{\theta }}{\partial \phi }}\right) {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}
+
{\frac {1}{r}}\left({\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}{\frac {\partial A_{r}}{\partial \phi }}
-
{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left(rA_{\phi }\right)\right) {\hat {\boldsymbol {\theta }}}
+
{\frac {1}{r}}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left(rA_{\theta }\right)
-
{\frac {\partial A_{r}}{\partial \theta }}\right) {\hat {\boldsymbol {\phi }}}$

In this problem, $A_r=A_\theta=0$ and $A_\phi=\alpha$.

Of the six terms involving partial derivatives, only two are non--zero, so

$\displaystyle\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} =
{\frac {1}{r\sin \theta }}\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}\left(A_{\phi }\sin \theta \right)
-
0\right) {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}
+
{\frac {1}{r}}\left(0
-
{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left(rA_{\phi }\right)\right) {\hat {\boldsymbol {\theta }}}
+
{\frac {1}{r}}\left( 0
-
0\right) {\hat {\boldsymbol {\phi }}}$.

Evaluation gives 

$\displaystyle\mathbf{B}= \frac{\alpha}{r\tan\theta}\hat {\mathbf {r} } - \frac{\alpha}{r}\hat{\boldsymbol {\theta }}$

One could also do the same calculation in cylindrical coordinates using

$\displaystyle\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = 
\left({\frac {1}{s }}{\frac {\partial A_{z}}{\partial \phi }}-{\frac {\partial A_{\phi }}{\partial z}}\right) {\hat {\boldsymbol {s }}}
+
\left({\frac {\partial A_{s}}{\partial z}}-{\frac {\partial A_{z}}{\partial s}}\right) {\hat {\boldsymbol {\phi }}}
+
{\frac {1}{s}}\left({\frac {\partial \left(s A_{\phi }\right)}{\partial s}}-{\frac {\partial A_{s}}{\partial \phi }}\right) {\hat {\mathbf {z} }}$

In this case,

$\displaystyle\mathbf{B}=\frac{\alpha}{s}\zhat$.

Using $\zhat = \cos\theta \hat {\mathbf {r} } - \sin\theta \hat {\boldsymbol {\theta} }$ and $s=r\sin\theta$, this is

$\displaystyle\mathbf{B}=\frac{\alpha}{r\sin\theta}\left(\cos\theta \hat {\mathbf {r} } - \sin\theta \hat {\boldsymbol {\theta} }\right)=\frac{\alpha}{r\tan\theta}\hat {\mathbf {r} } - \frac{\alpha}{r}\hat{\boldsymbol {\theta }}$,

which is the same as that found using the curl in spherical coordinates.

# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

If $\mathbf{A} = -\alpha y \zhat$ for $y\gt 0$ and $\mathbf{A} = +\alpha y \zhat$ for $y\lt 0$, where $\alpha$ is a constant,

1. find $\mathbf{B}$ and
2. plot $B_x(y)$.
3. Based on the plot for 2., what is the current system that produced this $\mathbf{B}$?

**Answer**

$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{\partial A_z }{\partial y} - \frac{\partial A_y }{\partial z} \right)\xhat +  \left(\frac{\partial A_x }{\partial z} - \frac{\partial A_z }{\partial x} \right)\yhat +  \left(\frac{\partial A_y }{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x }{\partial y} \right)\zhat $

$A_x=0$, $A_y=0$, and $A_z=\mp \alpha y$

Inserting zeros for terms involving partial derivative of $A_x$ and $A_y$ gives

$\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{\partial A_z }{\partial y} - 0 \right)\xhat +  \left(0 - \frac{\partial A_z }{\partial x} \right)\yhat +  \left(0 + 0\right)\zhat $

Evaluation gives

$\mathbf{B} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \mp\alpha\xhat$

This is the field of a sheet of current in the $x$--$y$ plane with current flowing in the $+\zhat$ direction. (To see this, draw out the bound current sheets and see [HW #11.1](hw11.html#two-current-sheet).

# Computing $\mathbf{B}$ given $\mathbf{A}$

The general equation for the vector potential for a magnetic dipole is

$$\mathbf{A}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{m}\times\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$$

If $\mathbf{m}=m_o\xhat$, find $\mathbf{B}$ in cartesian coordinates with cartesian unit vectors. Note that you can check your answer using equation 5.89 of Griffiths 4th edition:

$$\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{1}{r^3}\left[3(\mathbf{m}\bfcdot\hat{\mathbf{r}})\hat{\mathbf{r}} - \mathbf{m}\right]$$

**Answer**

_Method 1_

In [Magnetic Dipoles](magnetic_dipoles.html), the equation for a with dipole $\mathbf{m}=I\pi b^2\zhat$ was given as

$\displaystyle\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{I\pi b^2}{r^5}\left(3xz\hat{\mathbf{x}}+3yz\hat{\mathbf{y}}+(3z^2-r^2)\hat{\mathbf{z}}\right)$

Swapping $z$ and $x$ and replacing $I\pi b^2$ with $m_o$ gives the answer to this problem:

$\displaystyle\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{m_o}{r^5}\left[(3x^2-r^2)\hat{\mathbf{x}}+3xy\hat{\mathbf{y}}+3xz\hat{\mathbf{z}}\right]$

_Method 2_

Using $\mathbf{\hat{r}}=\mathbf{r}/r$ and $\mathbf{r}=x\xhat+y\yhat+z\zhat$,

$\displaystyle \mathbf{A}=\frac{\mu_om_o}{4\pi}\frac{\xhat\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^3}=\frac{\mu_om_o}{4\pi}\frac{\xhat\times (x\xhat+y\yhat+z\zhat)}{r^3}=\frac{\mu_om_o}{4\pi}\left(\frac{-z\yhat+y\zhat}{r^3}\right)$

Written fully in cartesian coordinates, this is

$\displaystyle \mathbf{A}=\frac{\mu_om_o}{4\pi}\left(\frac{-z\yhat+y\zhat}{\left(x^2+y^2+z^2\right)^{3/2}}\right)$

Using this and

$\displaystyle\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{\partial A_z }{\partial y} - \frac{\partial A_y }{\partial z} \right)\xhat +  \left(\frac{\partial A_x }{\partial z} - \frac{\partial A_z }{\partial x} \right)\yhat +  \left(\frac{\partial A_y }{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x }{\partial y} \right)\zhat$

will give the same answer as given above.

# (Extra credit) Computing $\mathbf{A}$

For a segment of wire that extends from $-L/2$ to $L/2$ on the $z$--axis with a current that flows in the $+z$ direction, find $\mathbf{A}(x)$.

**Answer**

In general,

$\displaystyle \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\int \frac{\mathbf{I}(\mathbf{r}')}{\char"0509}dl'$

For this problem,

$\displaystyle \mathbf{A}(x)=\frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2}\frac{I\zhat}{\sqrt{x^2+z'^2}}dz'$

Let $u=xz'$, then

$\displaystyle\mathbf{A}=\zhat\frac{\mu_oI}{4\pi}\frac{x}{|x|}\int_{-L/2x}^{L/2x} \frac{du}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}$

The integral can be evaluated using an [integral table](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+1%2Fsqrt%28a%5E2%2Bx%5E2%29).

$\displaystyle\int_{u_f}^{u_o}\frac{du}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}=\tanh^{-1}\left(\frac{u}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}}\right)\Bigg|_{u_f}^{u_o}$

# $\mathbf{B}$ Due to a Long Magnetized Solid Cylinder I.

A long solid cylinder of radius $R$ has a magnetization $\mathbf{M}=M_o\zhat$. The cylinder is centered on the origin and aligned with the $z$--axis.

1. Find the bound currents $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$.
2. Find $\mathbf{B}_b(s)$, which is the magnetic field due to the bound current densities found in part 1. of this problem.

**Answer**

1. $\mathbf{K}_b=M_o\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ on the curved surface, $\mathbf{K_b}=0$ on the top/bottom caps, and $\mathbf{J}_b=0$. 

2. The bound currents are equivalent to the current on a long solenoid, for which the current flows azimuthally around a cylinder. The magnetic field for a long solenoid of length $L$ is $\mathbf{B}=0$ outside and $B=\mu_o NI/L$ inside. The direction of this field is given by the right--hand rule. $N$ is the number of times the wire is wrapped around the cylinder. $N I/L$ corresponds to a surface current $K$, so the field inside can be written as $B=\mu_oK$. Replacing $K$ with $M_o$ and using the right--hand rule to conclude the direction of $\mathbf{B}_b$ is $+\zhat$ (which is the same direction as $\mathbf{M}$, as expected),  

   $\mathbf{B}_b=\mu_oM_o\zhat=\mu_o\mathbf{M}$ for $s\lt R$
   
   $\mathbf{B}_b=0$ for $s\gt R$.


# $\mathbf{B}$ Due to a Long Magnetized Solid Cylinder II.

A long cylinder of radius $R$ has a magnetization of $\mathbf{M}=(M_os/R)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$. The cylinder is centered on the origin and aligned with the $z$--axis.

1. Find the bound currents $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$.
2. Find $\mathbf{B}_b(s)$, which is the magnetic field due to the bound current densities found in part 1. of this problem.

**Answer**

If the cylinder is long, their contribution to $\mathbf{B}_b$ from the top and bottom caps can be neglected.

1. $\mathbf{K}_b=-M_o\zhat$ on side and $\mathbf{K}_b=\pm M_os/R$ on top/bottom cap. $\mathbf{J}_b=(2M_o/R)\zhat$.
2. $B_{b\phi}=\mu_oM_os/R$ from Ampere's law with an Amperian loop centered on the origin and in the $x$--$y$ plane. $B_s=B_z=0$ follows from thinking of the bound currents as being created my many closly spaced infinitely long wires and cancellation symmetry. Thus, $\mathbf{B}_b=(\mu_oM_os/R)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}=\mu_o\mathbf{M}$.

# Induced Magnetization

A long solid cylinder of inner radius $R_i$ and outer radius $R_o$ has a magnetic susceptibility of $\chi_m$ and is initially unmagnetized. The cylinder is centered on the origin and aligned with the $z$--axis.

There is an external magnetic field of $\displaystyle\mathbf{B}_{ext}=\frac{\mu_oI_{ext}}{2\pi s}\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$ that is created by a wire that runs along the $z$ axis.

The total field is given by $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}\_{ext} + \mathbf{B}_{b}$, where $\mathbf{B}_b$ is the field due to $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$ that are induced by the external magnetic field. 

It can be shown that $\mathbf{B}=(1+\chi_m)\mathbf{B}\_{ext}$ for $R_i\lt s\lt R_o$ and $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ for $s\lt R_i$ and $s\gt R_o$. That is, inside the cylinder, the material modifies the external field by a factor of $1+\chi_m$ and outside, the field is the same as it would be if the cylinder was not present.

This result was found using the assumption that the induced magnetization was related to the total field $\mathbf{B}$ according to

$$\mathbf{M}=\frac{\chi_m}{\mu_o(1+\chi_m)}\mathbf{B}$$

1. Find $\mathbf{K}\_b$ on the inner and outer curved surfaces of the cylinder in terms of $\mu\_o$, $\chi_m$, <strike>I<sub>ext</sub></strike>, $B_{\phi}$, and $R_o$ or $R_i$
2. Find $\mathbf{J}_b$
3. Show that these bound currents give $\mathbf{B}\_b$ such that $\mathbf{B}\_{ext} + \mathbf{B}_{b}$ matches the equation given form $\mathbf{B}$ for all $s$.

**Answer**

I did not grade this problem.

In the following, it is assumed that $B_s$ and $B_z$ are zero. This means that the induced magnetization has $M_s=0$ and $M_z=0$ due to the relationship between $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ given in the problem statement.

The symmetry argument that justifies the assumtion is somewhat subtle. 

Suppose that from your perspective $\mathbf{I}$ is upwards and $B_r$ is outwards. If you hung upsidedown, you see that a downward current also corresponds to an outwards $B_r$. However, accoring to the Biot--Savart law, changing the direction of $\mathbf{I}$ inverts the direction of the field and so upside--down you should see an inwards $B_r$. The only way for consistency is if $B_r$ is zero.

Far from the $z$--axis, the field due to the external and bound currents must approach zero. Ampere's law and the fact that $B_z$ is independent of $z$ can be used to show that $B_z$ is independent of distance from the $z$--axis using a square loop in the $s$--$z$. Together, this implies $B_z=0$. (A similar argument was used to justify $B=0$ outside of a long solenoid in Example 5.9 of Griffiths.)

In the following, I do the problem without assuming that   $\mathbf{B}=(1+\chi_m)\mathbf{B}\_{ext}$. In the original problem statement, I had suggested that you do it this (easier) way, which is why I asked to write the bound currents in terms of $I_{ext}$. However, in class I started to do the problem without using this assumption and is the reason that I changed the problem statement for part 1.

1.

$\mathbf{M}=\chi\mathbf{B}\quad \Rightarrow \quad M_\phi(s)=\chi B_\phi(s)$

$\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ inner}}=\mathbf{M}(R_i)\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}=M_\phi(R_i)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times(-\hat{\mathbf{s}})=+M_\phi(R_i)\zhat$

$\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ outer}}=\mathbf{M}(R_o)\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}=M_\phi(R_o)\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\times(+\hat{\mathbf{s}})=-M_\phi(R_o)\zhat$

$\displaystyle\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}\_{ext} + \mathbf{B}\_{b} \quad \Rightarrow \quad B\_\phi(s)=B_{\phi\text{ }ext} + B_{\phi b}$

Let $\chi=\chi_m/[(1+\chi_m)\mu_o]$. Using $B_\phi = \chi M_\phi$ gives

$\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ inner}}=+\chi B_\phi(R_i)\zhat$

$\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ outer}}=-\chi B_\phi(R_i)\zhat$

2.

$\displaystyle\mathbf{J}_b=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{M}=\frac{1}{s}\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(sM_\phi(s))\zhat$

Using $B_\phi = \chi M_\phi$ gives

$\displaystyle\mathbf{J}_b=\frac{\chi}{s}\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(sB_\phi(s))\zhat$

3.

% Note that a symmetry argument is need to conclude non--phi components of B are zero.

Ampere's law for the bound currents gives

$2\pi s B_{\phi b} = \mu_oI_{b\text{ }encl}$

----
$s\lt R_i$

$I_{b\text{ }encl}=0$, so Ampere's law gives $B_{\phi b}=0$ and $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}\_{ext} + \mathbf{B}\_{b}$ gives $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}\_{ext}$.

----

$R_i\lt s\lt R_o$

$I_{b\text{ }encl}$ is due to $\mathbf{K}_{b\text{ inner}}$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$ 

$\displaystyle I_{b\text{ }encl}=2\pi R_iK_{b\text{ inner}} + \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{R_i}^s\frac{\chi}{s'}\frac{\partial}{\partial s'}(s'B_\phi(s'))s'ds'$

$\displaystyle I_{b\text{ }encl}=2\pi \chi R_iB_\phi(R_i)+2\pi\chi\big[sB_\phi(s)-R_iB_\phi(R_i)\big]$

The first and last terms cancel, leaving

$\displaystyle I_{b\text{ }encl}=2\pi\chi sB_\phi(s)$

Substitution of this into $2\pi s B_{\phi b} = \mu_oI_{b\text{ }encl}$ from Ampere's law gives

$B_{\phi b}(s)=\chi B_{\phi}(s)$

Substituion of this into $B\_\phi(s)=B_{\phi\text{ }ext} + B_{\phi b}$

gives

$B\_\phi(s)=B_{\phi\text{ }ext} + \chi B_{\phi}$

and finally

$B_\phi(s)=(1+\chi_m)B_{\phi\text{ }ext}$.

----
For $s\gt R_i$

$I_{b\text{ }encl}$ is the bound current on both surfaces plus the bound current flowing through the volume of the material. It is zero, which follows from

$\displaystyle I_{b\text{ }encl}=2\pi R_iK_{b\text{ inner}} +2\pi R_oK_{b\text{ outer}} + \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{R_i}^{R_o}\frac{\chi}{s'}\frac{\partial}{\partial s'}(s'B_\phi(s'))s'ds'=0$

$I_{b\text{ }encl}=0$, so Ampere's law gives $B_{\phi b}=0$ and $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}\_{ext} + \mathbf{B}\_{b}$ gives $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}\_{ext}$.

----
