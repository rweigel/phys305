= \(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}\) and \(\nabla\times\mathbf{E}\) =

From Coulomb's Law for the electric field

$$\mathbf{E} = ...$$

and vector calculus, the following equations result

Gauss' Law in differential form
$$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \rho/\epsilon_0$$

Graphically this means ...

Gauss' Law in integral form

$$\oint_{S}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a} = Q_{Inside\,S}/\epsilon_0$$

Graphically this means ...

We often speak of "Electric Flux", which is defined as

$$\Phi_E\equiv\oint_{S} \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}$$
