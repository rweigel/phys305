= Symmetry =

Given identical point charges placed at the corners of an \(N\)-sided polygon
* Find force on test charge \(q_o\) placed at center for \(N=12\)
* Suppose one charge is removed, what is the force on \(q_o\)?
* Repeat above for \(N+1\) charges with \(N>1\).

= Superposition =

A charge at \(y = 1\) m exerts a force in the \(-y-\)direction on a charge at the origin and no other charges exist. If a charge is placed at \(x = 1\) m, I predict that the force in the \(-y-\)direction will not change on the charge at the origin.  There are two reasons (1) The charge at \(x = 1\) produces a force that is in the \(-x-\)direction.  What is the second reason?

Perhaps the charge at \(x = 1\) gets "lazy" and decides to not push down so hard when there is another charge nearby. The principle of superposition state that this does not happen. Coulomb's Law is for the force between two point charges.  It does not state what happens when more than one charge creates a force.  Note that Coulomb's Law and the Principle of Superposition is Electrostatics.
