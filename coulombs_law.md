= Coulomb's Law =

$$\mathbf{E} = \frac{q'}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|^2}\frac{\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}$$

Notation
* A primed vector, \(\mathbf{r}'\) is usually used for location of a charge that is exerting a force on another charge.  An unprimed vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is usually used for the location of the charge for which the force is being calculated.

== Definition ==

Two charges \(q\) and \(q_o\) are separated by a distance \(d\).  Write down the equation for the magnitude of the force that each charge exerts on each other.

== Use ==

Write down formal version of Coulomb's Law (with script "r") and define all symbols; use a diagram if necessary.

<math>q</math> is located at <math>(x,y,z) = (0,0,1)</math>; <math>Q</math> is located <math>(x,y,z) = (0,1,0)</math>.  The force of <math>q</math> on <math>Q</math> is <math>\mathbf{F}_{qQ} = \frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_0}(a\hat{\mathbf{x}} + b\hat{\mathbf{y}} + c\hat{\mathbf{z}})</math>.  What are <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math>?  What is <math>F</math> (or <math>|\mathbf{F}|</math>)?

Use the formula <math>F = kqQ/d^2</math> to check your answer and signs.

== Definition ==

Two charges \(q\) and \(q_o\) are separated by a distance \(d\) and \(q >> q_o\).  Is the magnitude of the force that \(q\) exerts on \(q_o\) smaller, equal to, or larger than the force that \(q_o\) exerts on \(q\)?

== Definition ==

Write down Coulomb's Law in vector form for the force a charge \(q\) at \(\mathbf{r}'\) exerts on a charge \(q_o\) at \(\mathbf{r}\). Neither charge is at the origin. Define all symbols and draw a diagram.

== Use ==

Given the location of a charge and the position of a test charge in cartesian coordinates, draw, to scale, (1) \(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\) and (2) the unit vector associated with (1).  Compute their values with correct units. That is, make up your own problem like the previous problem and use the techniques given in class to make sure your answer is correct.

== Derivation ==

Suppose that Newton uniformly charged a spherical shell and found that everywhere inside the shell, a small test charge experienced no force.  When the test charge was placed outside of the shell, it moved radially away from the shell. Provide an explanation for why it is reasonable for him to conclude that the force between two charges will depend on the inverse of the square of their separation and be directed along a straight line that connects them.

This is somewhat of a subtle question written to emphasize some of the important properties of an inverse square force law.  Newton's Law of gravity, which has a magnitude of \(F=GmM/d^2\) and direction along the straight line that connects the masses, is an inverse square law.  In Physics I, you learned that particle inside of an empty shell felt zero force everywhere inside of the shell.  Outside of the shell, the mass experienced a radial force.
