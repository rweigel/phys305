# Introduction

An electric field is created by charges. The charges that create the electric field can be stationary or moving.

A stationary or moving charge $q$ in an electric field (created by other charges) experiences a force of

$$\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}$$

A magnetic field is created by moving charges. (A stationary charge **does not** create a magnetic field.) A moving charge $q$ in a magnetic field (created by other moving charges) experiences a force of

$$\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}$$

The direction of the force on $q$ is perpendicular to a plane that contains $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. This plane can be visualized by imagining orienting a piece of paper such that both the  $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ vectors lie on the paper.

The magnitude of $\mathbf{F}$ can be computed using the above equation or

$$F = qvB\sin\theta$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ and $\theta \le 180^{\circ}$. (For example, the angle between two vectors can be said to be $10^{\circ}$ or $350^{\circ}$. In the above equation, use $10^{\circ}$ -- if $350^{\circ}$ was used, we would get a negative value for the magnitude of a vector, which is positive by definition.)

There are two special cases for which the general equation $\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}$ simplifies:

1. If the direction of motion is perpendicular to the magnetic field (so that $\theta = 90^{\circ}$), the magnitude of the force is $F = qvB$ and the direction is determined by right-hand-rule.
2. If the direction of motion is parallel to the magnetic field (so that $\theta = 0^{\circ}$), the magnitude of the force is $F = 0$.

In these notes, we are given $\mathbf{B}$ and we compute the resulting force on a moving charge using the Lorentz force law. 
Magnetic fields are created by moving charges, so this given $\mathbf{B}$ must be created by a configuration of moving charges, and in the next set of notes, we determine the magnetic field that results from charges flowing in a closed loop at a constant speed using the Biot--Savart law.

Similarly, we we first started using $\mathbf{F}_E=q\mathbf{E}$, we were given an electric field $\mathbf{E}$. Electric fields are created by charges, so the given $\mathbf{E}$ must have been created by charges, and we computed $\mathbf{E}$ due to various charge configurations using Coulomb's law.

The Lorentz force law allows us to calculate $\mathbf{F}$ given $\mathbf{v}$.
