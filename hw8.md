# Perfect Dipole on $x$--axis

In class, I showed how one can use the equation

$\displaystyle V = \frac{kq}{\char"0509} = \frac{kq}{r}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^nP_n(\cos\alpha)$

to find an approximation for $V(\mathbf{r})$ for charges $\pm q$ at $z=\pm d/2$ and keeping only the $n=0$ and $n=1$ terms. I then showed how the equation

$\displaystyle V(\mathbf{r})=k\frac{\mathbf{p}\bfcdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$

gives the same result.

1\. Follow the procedure used in class to find $V(\mathbf{r})$ for charges $\pm q$ at $x=\pm d/2$ using the $n=0$ and $n=1$ terms of

$\displaystyle V = \frac{kq}{\char"0509} = \frac{kq}{r}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{r'}{r}\right)^nP_n(\cos\alpha)$

and also

$\displaystyle V(\mathbf{r})=k\frac{\mathbf{p}\bfcdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$

2\. Find $\mathbf{E}$ with spherical coordinates and unit vectors using the $V(\mathbf{r})$ that you computed in part 1.

# Slab of Charge

In 4.2 of Griffiths, he models a polarized sphere by using two uniformly charged spheres with centers that are separated by a small distance $d$. One sphere has a postive charge and the other a negative charge. He then computes the electric field in the overlap region and in the region outside of both spheres where there is no overlap.

In this problem, a polarized slab will be modeled by using two slabs of charge with uniform and opposite charge density that are displaced by a small distance $d$.

1. Find $\mathbf{E}(y)$ for the slab with uniform charge density $\rho_o$ shown in the following figure. Assume that the slab is infinite in extent in the $\pm z$ and $\pm x$ directions so that Gauss's law can be used. (This slab can be thought of as being composed of thin sheets of charge stacked together and so an alternative to using Gauss's law is to sum the electric field due to sheets of charge.)

2. Plot $\mathbf{E}(y)$ vs $y$.

3. Next, compute and plot $\mathbf{E}(y)$ for the same slab if it had charge density of $-\rho_o$ and was shifted by $-d$ in the $y$--direction. Assume that $d\ll t$.

4. Compute $\mathbf{E}$ in the region of overlap of the $+\rho_o$ and $-\rho_o$ slabs.
