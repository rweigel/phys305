**Final Exam Study Guide**

The final exam will have five problems. It is from 10:30 am - 1:15 pm on Thursday, December 9th, in Innovation Hall, room 131.

Ideally, you would prepare by 

1. Redoing the homework problems without looking at the solution (and only looking at the part that you need to take another step if you are stuck).

  In many homework problems, I have asked you to figure out the solution's features before attempting to find them. Thinking about the expected features of the solution when you are stuck often helps and is much more beneficial than checking the solution.

2. Doing the example and supplementary problems in the notes; and

3. Doing the example problems in chapters 2-6 of Griffiths related to the problems in 1. and 2. above.

I spoke with many students who did poorly on the first exam. A common part of their description of their preparation involved memorizing equations and reading solutions. As I have discussed many times, reading solutions are essentially a waste of time. You may instead want to use your time more productively by, say, playing tiddlywinks or Goat Simulator.

At this point, having someone who knows how to solve a problem explain its solution to you is also generally a waste of time. It is 50x more helpful if you present your solution and thought process to someone else. If you get stuck, seek out only suggestions for things to think about.

**Problem 1.** will be a short answer problem involving one or more of: Conceptual questions on [Gauss's law](gauss_law.html) and/or Ampere's law, and drawing the vector field for a given charge or current distribution.

**Problems 2. and 3.** will involve two of

* Finding an integral for $\mathbf{E}$ for a continuous charge distribution (the integral will not need to be evaluated; you will need to be able to do all of the other steps). See problems in [Continuous Charge Distributions](continuous_charge_distributions.html).
* Finding $\mathbf{E}$, $V$, and $\sigma$ for charge distributions and conductor shapes for which Gauss's law can be used. See problems in [Gauss's law](gauss_law.html). Explaining the reason Gauss's law can or cannot be used.
* 1--D boundary value problems -- Derive the general equation for $V$ in cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical. See problems in [1-D Boundary Value Problems](boundary_value_problems.html#1-d). Find $V$ given boundary conditions. Find $\sigma$ given $V$ (as was done in [HW 5.2](hw5.html#1-d-boundary-value-problem)). Also, solving a problem using only Gauss's law (as was done in [HW 5.1](hw5.md!#spherical-capacitor)).
* 2--D cartesian boundary value problems (either find an equation that satisfies 3 of the 4 boundary conditions or given an equation that satisfies 3 of the four boundary conditions, find $V$ using Fourier's trick). For this, do examples 3.3 and 3.4 of Griffith's, the homework problems, and variations on the homework problem ($V_o$ at all possible sides, for example). See also [2-D Boundary Value Problems](boundary_value_problems.html#1-2-cartesian).
* Finding the exact equation for $\mathbf{E}$ and $V$ for a discrete charge distribution and using the binomial expansion equation to find an approximation at large distances from the charges.
* Using the general [monopole expansion equation](monopole_expansion.html) to find an approximate expression for $V$ due to one or more point charges.

**Problems 4. and 5.** will involve two of

* Computing $\sigma_b$ and $\rho_b$ given $\mathbf{P}$
* Computing the electric field due to bound surface or volume charges.
* Computing the total electric field for a polarizable object immersed in an external electric field.
* Finding the force on a current--carrying object given an external magnetic field.
* Using the Biot--Savart equation to find the magnetic field due to a current--carrying object.
* Using Ampere's law, if applicable, to find the magnetic field. Explaining the reason Ampere's law can or cannot be used.
* Computing $\mathbf{K}_b$ and $\mathbf{J}_b$ given $\mathbf{M}$
* Computing the magnetic field due to the bound surface or volume currents.
* Computing the total magnetic field when a magnetizable object is immersed in an external magnetic field.

The equations that you should understand and know without reference are

* Differential lengths for a circle or an curve; differential areas for a cylinder's cap or side; differential area for a sphere; differential volume for a cylinder and sphere.
* The general equation for Coulomb's Law for a point charge and charge densities;
* The general equation for electric potential due to a point charge;
* Gauss' Law in integral and differential form with an understanding of the meaning of all terms;
* Integral and differential relationship between electric field and electric potential;
* Gradient, divergence, and Laplacian in cartesian coordinates;
* "Basic" derivatives and integrals;
* The general equation for the Lorentz Force law;
* The general equation for the Biot--Savart law for a current loop;
* Ampere's law in integral and differential form;
* The equations for bound charge densities and bound current densities;
* Any equations not in this list will be given as needed.

I will pay even more attention to notation on this exam. For example,

1. equations for scalars should not be written with unit vectors on the right-hand-side; and
2. integrals over a closed surface or line should be written as $\oint$.

Regarding item 1. above, it is understandable that sometimes unit vectors are dropped or arrows above variables are missed. However, if these errors are too frequent, I must assume that you don't understand basic vector notation and factor this into your score accordingly.

When I am grading, I am looking for evidence that you understood something.  If you are stuck, explain what you understand. Note that writing an equation that you have memorized that is related to the problem only shows a minimal amount of understanding. 

%A -- Can explain at a conceptual level how to solve HW problems and Griffiths example problems correctly and can justify all of the steps. Evidence for this is solutions to exam problems with correct justifications, most of the needed justifications addressed, and a few algebraic errors. In addition, when the final solution does not make sense, the reason is stated.

%C -- Difficulties solving problems that were covered in a freshman--level physics course. Weak understanding of the justifications and motivations for steps in HW problems and Griffiths example problems. 

%F -- A lack of understanding of fundamental concepts covered in freshman--level physics course. Evidence for this includes writing equations that are correct but not related to the problem, writing solutions that are clearly wrong based on basic concepts without an explanation why the solution is clearly wrong.
